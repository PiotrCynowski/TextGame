## Overview

** Players interact via typed commands like `look`, `take key`, or `move table`, and progress through rooms defined using `ScriptableObject`s.

All logic for commands, objects, and room progression is modular and extensible‚Äîmaking it a great starting point for building narrative puzzles, educational games, or interactive fiction.
